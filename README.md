Introduction
============

DIAMOND is a sequence aligner for protein and translated DNA searches,
designed for high performance analysis of big sequence data. The key
features are:

-   Pairwise alignment of proteins and translated DNA at 100x-10,000x
    speed of BLAST.
-   [Protein clustering of up to tens of billions of proteins](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond/wiki/Clustering)
-   Frameshift alignments for long read analysis.
-   Low resource requirements and suitable for running on standard
    desktops or laptops.
-   Various output formats, including BLAST pairwise, tabular and XML,
    as well as taxonomic classification.

About
=====
Since 2019, DIAMOND is developed by Benjamin Buchfink at the Drost lab, Max Planck
Institute for Biology Tübingen. From 2018-2019, its development was supported by the
German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy through an EXIST grant.
From 2016-2018, it was developed by Benjamin Buchfink as an independent researcher.
From 2013-2015, the initial version was developed by Benjamin Buchfink at the Huson lab,
University of Tübingen, Germany.
